    <h1>Why i study coding?</h1>
    <h2>It's a complicated question but let's take a closer look</h2>
    <p>I wouldn't say that coding was my dream or it's something i wanted to do as a kid. It all started when i was twelve. It's just happened to be covid time and software developing got really popular. I was watching videos online, getting to know something about programming languages. Then i tried to code myself. Watched more videos, looked for "programming" memes. Maybe that made me feel proud, to understand all of those fancy words. Some kid's mere interest.</p>
    <p>Then i got to know people who was interested by it too. I attended some competition for girls, who tried to solve problems with digital solutions, like apps. I saw them and worked wih them and probably something clicked in me. <b>That</b> was the community i saw myself in. There were the people i wanted to look up to, to be like.</p>
    <p>Right now my goal is to go to college in "computer science" major to be with people like this, to build something together and improve every day. After what i could work on indepentent project or work at company with a team and solve problems together. Coding is a way to connect, to build and create to me.</p>
    <p>also not in the mood of the text, but i'd like to add a quote i really like and somehow find comfort in</p>
